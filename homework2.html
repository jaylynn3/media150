    <h1>Reading + reflection 2: With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster by Nesrine Malik & Photos</h1>

    <p>
        This article was a good explanation about what is currently going on, online, right now, 
        in regards to Ai usage. Although it was written almost a year ago from the time I am writing 
        this, the prevalence of Ai videos, photos, and other miscellaneous contents have only grown 
        even more over time.  In my opinion, there is variably no good reason why Ai should exist in 
        the ways that it has been being used today. As a product, there is no general problem with Ai 
        as it could be, and is already has being used in little ways, for a long time. After all, the 
        autocorrected words that appear as I write and make spelling mistakes in this response are a 
        convenient feature that has been brought about by the creation of Ai and machine learning. What 
        upsets me so much is the use of Ai art and those Ai programs that advertise themselves as a method 
        of cheating and getting ahead. To begin with the latter, Ai is already showing its negative effects 
        on young people especially as they rely too heavily on Ai for simple things such as homework assignments. 
        As a college student myself it is tempting to gravitate towards Ai tools when things get hard but without 
        facing hardship, I know that it will get increasingly harder to navigate solving problems in my future 
        when Ai is inaccessible to me. As an artist, watching Ai steal from an amalgamation of incredible works 
        and then “create” a new imagine is fascinating, but disappointing. I firmly believe that Ai “creation” is 
        far from true creation as it is nothing but a regurgitation of previous, uncredited works. Watching my 
        parents, as well as other elder people get sucked into the likeness of Ai videos and sharing them about 
        on platforms like WhatsApp is something from the reading that I can relate to. It’s worrying how so many 
        people are beginning to lose sight of what is real or fake, and begin to show signs of being too trusting 
        of what is said online! Outdoors at places like restaurants and local shopping places, Ai art is present 
        as people turn to the cheapest form of labor possible. I find it disgusting that institutions who are so 
        desiring to be perceived as “good” or worth visiting have the nerve to display logos generated by Artificial 
        intelligence instead of creating a real logo themselves that could so much better display their business’ 
        personality. One good thing that I do find about Ai however is how hyper aware I’ve become about my internet 
        consumption lately. Ai has made me less interested in checking some social media apps at times and the times in 
        between my social media usage I have been reflecting about how I spend my time each day and how I want to spend 
        that time in the future. I’ve come to appreciate reading real primary documents, exploring the real world more 
        often, and getting away from the cyberspace a little more as things strange “intelligence” brings chaos onto our 
        online world.
