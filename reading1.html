    <p>Please write a 500+ word reflection on how you use photography and image making. 
    How could you represent visually through photography or illustration or the 
    combination of image and text notions of our world at this moment?: </p>
    <p>I use photography and image making as a way to capture the things around, as well as the moments that 
        I find to be meaningful. Taking a photo for example, allows me to capture one specific moment in
        time, and turn it into a longlife memory that I can look back on and even share with others. Photography allows
        me to express my perspective on different situations in a way that words sometimes cannot and gives me the 
        opportunity to reflect more on the life I've experienced so far. Without photography, many of the well captured
        and documented moments in history would have been lost to time and having the chance to take photos myself, of whatever 
        I choose, is a privelage that I will never take for granted. 
    </p>
    <p> My favorite things to incoorporate in image making
        are items and people who I find impressionable in my life. I love illustrating people from my point of view
        and drawing others is my way of showing them how they make me feel. If I'm not
        directly drawing somebody, I still enjoy drawing for them whether it be something that they request,
        or things that I know they would like to see. Still life, landscape, and flowers
        are also my favorite things to draw because they represent the vibrancy of mundane life. 
        At this very moment, I could come up with a multitude of different ways to combine images and 
        text notions in order to represent our world. If I were to create a piece of artwork that
        did this, I would photograph meaningful events such as protests occur around my area such as outside of 
        my school, advertisements that indirectly reveal the political climate of today, and casual images of what 
        life right now is like. Scrolling on the internet will reveal to you so many meaningful images that speak 
        beyond words and could be understood by anyone who sees them even without text. Despite this, certain text
        accompaniying the images I create could help to further explain the context of the images and give the viewer a deeper understanding
        of what is being represented. Overall, I believe that photography and image making are powerful things that can be used to
        express complex ideas and emotions. Text notions serve a great purpose in furthering the viewer's understanding 
        of their meanings.
