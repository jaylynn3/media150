    <h1 class="lobster-regular">Jaylynn Hemmings Lab: 05</h1>
    <p>My name is Jaylynn, I am a student at Hunter College studying Computer Science and appreciate the intersections
        between technology and the arts. I am working towards becoming a technical product designer, someone who
        works behind the scenes in the development of various products, who oversees, designs and ensures a products 
        usable outcome from its earliest beginning stages, to the end. My primary focuses are on web development, drawing, 
        as well as digital design and I believe that art work can be found everywhere. It doesn't matter which type of field, 
        a project might be developed in because art can, and will be found, and it is intrinsic for all great
        things. My work may be described as, intentional and intuitive. I create designs that assist people in 
        their daily lives, make digital experiences more accessible, and create an engaging atmosphere for viewers 
        by highlighting things that I personally find to be beautiful in the world around me 
        (flowers, pretty colors, pretty things). I want make more physical forms of media such that require
        you to work with your hands. I want to produce paintings, films, and pottery. My overall goal is to 
        explore the intersectionality of digital media, physical media, and the world. Afterall, everything we
        interact with is connected to the arts in some sense, one way or another. ☘︎</p>
